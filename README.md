# Synthetic-Credit-Card-Approval-
### About
   Synthetic Credit Card a are computer-generated credit data that refer to the same client/product characteristics tracked by a production system, adopt the same credit lifecycle typology (possible events and measured elements), conform to the actual schema (data template) that is being emulated, and have the same or similar statistical properties as the credit data set that is being emulated. 

AIM:
   The objective of this project is to perform data analysis on the given datset, and classify the data on target variable.
   
### Dataset
 DATASET:
 The dataset has attribute columns that determine the risk of having cervical cancer. The dataset has 500000 rows and 6 columns.
 The columns in the dataset are:
  * ‘Num_Children’
  * ‘Group’
  * ‘Income’
  * ‘Own_Car’
  * ‘Own_Housing’ 
  * ‘Target’

### Conclusion:
  * We see that owning a car an owning a house is clearly dependent on the income of a person, on which the credit card approval must be based.
